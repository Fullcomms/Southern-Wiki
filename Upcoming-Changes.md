# What needs changing?

At the moment the CMS reflects what was previously possible within the old CMS with the exception of lead management which is now done within Full Circle. Things that need changing/adding are more personalisation tweaks and quality of life additions, some examples of the things in mind are as follows.

## Admin Homepage

[Admin Homepage](shosales.co.uk/admin/home) <- This page at the moment is very bare and simply contains a counter of live properties, live resales & live new homes. 

What is planned for this page is:-

* ToDo List - I'll be implementing a todo list here that will be completely interactive by the user and will have set completion dates so upon initial login the CMS user can clearly see what they need to do on said day and also add new tasks themselves. Management will also have access to an area where they can assign tasks to CMS users that will appear on this _todo list_. 
* Live Property List - This will be a comprehensive list of properties with various statistics to accompany them such as No. of registrations in the past week, month, year etc. Number of upcoming viewings (bookings) for this property, Number of cancelled viewings for this property. 
* Quick Access Links - For example if a property is sat in _pending_ it will display here and will be a hyperlink to edit that property to add marketing information. If a property is sat here for longer than a week it will drop off this list but you will still be able to navigate to this listing via view listings.

As mentioned on the home page of this wiki as these things are added we will update the wiki accordingly.

## Administrator Area

This area will be created for Management to use so they can view pending tasks & assign new todo's to CMS users along with a few other small tools such as activity logs (for seeing who updated what and when).

# Conclusion

If you have any ideas on any additions to the CMS that will make your job easier to do then get in touch with a member of management and they will pass this on to us if they think it's a required addition to the CMS.
