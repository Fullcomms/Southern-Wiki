# Pages

This area is for the creation and management of new pages such as Location Pages, Home Page content, Terms & Conditions and so on. 

## Create New Page & Edit Page

Within the sidebar if you click Create New Page it will direct you through to the Page creation area. This area is pretty much identical to the Edit Page so for any questions regarding editing a page please use this area.

At the top of the creation area the page requires you to select a template. This will seamlessly load in all the relevant fields required to build that specific page depending on the template you choose.

Some of these templates contain what we call _repeatable fields_ which is represented by an **Add New Field** button which will add a series of additional fields that are repeats.

# News Posts

This area is for the creation, edit & deletion of posts displayed within the news section of the site. 

This area has had minimal changes due to it already being very intuitive. 

## Creating & Editing Posts

As with pages both Editing & Creating posts are identical.

Another similarity between pages and post creation is the template is selected at the top and the page will refresh with the appropriate fields.

As mentioned these areas have had minimal changes so you should feel fairly comfortable creating a new news post. The only change/addition again is the new image uploader

Once all the required fields have been completed and the images have been added click submit and it should save the news post and will be displayed on the frontend on the scheduled date set.

# Landing Pages

This area is where landing pages are edited & created. 

Again minimal changes have been made to this area aside from the fact that an _external property_ can no longer be assigned to a landing page. This is because external properties are no longer used in the CMS. 

## Create New Landing Page

This is where the landing page is created and the content for the landing page is assigned.

Select a property the landing page is to be associated with, the source the landing page is used for e.g Facebook, Google and add the relevant content to be displayed on the landing page. 

For adding images, if these fields are left blank the images from the property will be used. For example if Rose Garden is linked to the landing page the Logo, Hero Image & Gallery Images displayed on the listing page will be used. 

If you add images then by default the images uploaded to the landing page will be the ones displayed and not the images on the listing page. 

# Testimonials

This is where testimonials that are displayed on the Homepage are edited & created.

## View Testimonials (or just Testimonials)

This page is different due to the way it is laid out. Both creation and edit is done within the View Testimonials page. 

To edit, simply change the text of the testimonial you wish you edit and click edit. This will save the changes to the database. 

If you scroll to the bottom of this page you are able to create a completely new testimonial.

2 simple fields, Name of the person who gave the testimonial and the testimonial they gave once completed hit submit.

# Home Ownership Hub

This is where new services are created, edited & deleted for the Home Ownership Hub area of the site. 

## View Services

The only difference between this area and any of the other areas is the _Add Content_ button when creating/editing a service. This will add more fields for adding more content to the page. 

Again once all the required fields have been completed hit submit and the created/changed service will be saved and displayed on the frontend.

Enquiry enabled switch will either enable or disable the register interest form.

Calculator enabled switch will either enable or disable the calculator on the page.

# Settings

This is an area that always had great confusion surrounding it within the old CMS. 

This area is for editing any content on the site that doesn't fall into any of the above categories. Some examples are as follows:-

* Property Preference Form - Page Bottom - editing this will change the text at the bottom of the property preference form.
* Home Ownership Hub - Hub Title - editing this will change the text displayed as the title on the Home Ownership Hub.
* Default - Address - editing this will change anywhere that the address is displayed on the frontend of the website.
* Default - Twitter - editing this will change the link to the twitter profile shown across the site

All of the entries within this area follow similar suit, as they are titled is pretty much what they are. All of the pages have core parent pages such as where news posts are kept, this page where all of the news posts are listed out is a parent of the news posts and may contain content like "Read through our exciting blog posts" (<- this is not verbatim just an example of what is meant by parent page) when a user clicks to view a news post from this _parent page_ they are shown the content created/edited within the View News Posts area whereas the content on the _parent page_ is set within Settings.
